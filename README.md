# Stein Core Summary

This respository contains Luke Stein's summary notes from the Stanford graduate economics core as it was taught in 2006-7.

Abbreviated sources are listed in parentheses after each topic, with fuller descriptions in the "References" section. Most of the content is copied verbatim (or only minimally rewritten) from the indicated sources; errors in the source materials are now in the good company of numerous additional errors I have presumably introduced in writing/compiling these notes.

Formatting is largely through LaTeX's `extarticle` class, with some additions from the included `intcheetsheet.sty` package (and its dependencies).
